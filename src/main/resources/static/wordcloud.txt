 I was walking through a dark forest and I started to feel really uneasy, like something was watching me. Then I heard rustling in the bushes and started to panic. I tried to run away but the forest seemed never-ending and the rustling got louder. Suddenly, a pack of wolves appeared and surrounded me. I was so scared I couldn't move or even scream. I could feel their breath on my skin and I thought they were going to attack me. Then I woke up and realized it was just a dream, but it still freaked me out. In my dream, I was on a beautiful beach with crystal clear water and white sand. The sun was shining and there was a gentle breeze blowing. I felt so happy and carefree, like all my worries had melted away.

I spent the day swimming in the ocean and playing beach volleyball with a group of friends I haven't seen in years. We laughed and joked around like we were kids again, and it was the most fun I've had in a long time.

As the sun started to set, we built a bonfire and sat around it, roasting marshmallows and sharing stories. I felt so grateful to have such amazing people in my life, and I knew that this moment would stay with me forever.

When it was time to leave, I hugged my friends goodbye and watched as they disappeared into the distance. But even as they faded from view, I felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over me. I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, I would always have this memory to hold onto and cherish.
