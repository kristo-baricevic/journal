In my dream, I found myself walking through the dense Black Forest in Germany. The moonlight barely penetrated the thick canopy, and I started to feel really uneasy, like something was watching me. Then I heard rustling in the bushes and started to panic. I tried to run away but the forest seemed never-ending, and the rustling got louder. Suddenly, a pack of gray wolves with piercing blue eyes appeared and surrounded me. I was so scared I couldn't move or even scream. I could feel their hot breath on my skin, and I thought they were going to attack me. Then I woke up and realized it was just a dream, but it still freaked me out. I took a deep breath and reached for my phone to check the time. It was made by Apple and showed that it was 3:33 am. I felt my heart rate slowly returning to normal as I remembered the safety tips I learned during my recent camping trip with REI. I took a sip of water from my Nalgene bottle and tried to calm down.
