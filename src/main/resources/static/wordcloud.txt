I was moving away from St. Louis and all of my things were spread out. Some were at Sean's parents house. Some were at Sarah and Zeng's house. Some were at the house I lived at. Most had already been moved to my new home in Philadelphia but I was back to get the rest. During this dream I was at a party and ran into several old punks who had become police officers. One of them was Tom, a drummer with whom I joked that real punks always show their license and registration. He had said he got the job because he had a kid and needed the money. I also saw Ashley, with whom I spoke about moving. For some reason I told her I was moving to Chattanooga even though that was not the case. I continued walking around this party at my dream until it became time to start packing. But I quickly realized I did not have enough room in my car to take everything. I had gotten a ride from Sarah and Nina back to the house where my stuff was to figure it out. The night before Nina had kept crawling into bed with me and turning on the TV or stereo, and jumping up and down. Eventually I told her I had to go to sleep and to leave the TV off and she went away. Before I knew it I was getting my things ready but I just decided to leave it all behind. The next thing I knew I was in a car driving through the winding roads of a heavily wooded mountain. Someone else was driving. It may have been my older brother at one point, but the person kept changing. At first it seemed like a self-driving car because we were both in the back seat, but the driver was making decisions. We stopped at a strip mall for a break and the ground kept tilting like a slow moving earthquake. We wanted to continue driving but there was a forest fire so we got a hotel room. In the hotel room I was all of a sudden with Larva and we were watching TV while engaging in a sex act. Over time we both turned into spiders that were making out on a fire escape, until it became time for her to go into a nightclub below us and perform as part of a comedy act.  The last segment of this dream started with me driving through my hometown of Fairview Heights and cutting through the church and school. For some reason I saw a bicycle that was abandoned in the middle of the road and I picked it up, even though I knew this would make it seem like I had kidnapped the owner of this bike. I took it my childhood home and already could hear people making phone calls all around me, looking for the owner the bicycle who was a little girl. The news media was even picking up on the story. The young girl was not present but I did have her bike. I put the bike in the corner of the garage, behind another bike, thinking this would hide it. Everybody was blaming me for kidnapping the girl and shortly the girls mother came by to look for her or the bike. I was nonchalantly making breakfast in the microwave. I was constantly checking to make sure the eggs were cooked all the way through while my father was talking to the girls mom, helping her check the house for the girl and\or the bicycle. The girl's mom even checked the garage but there was no bike to be found at that point. I'm not sure what happened to the bike or the girl, but I did eventually eat my breakfast in the family room where the chess table used to be.

In another part of the dream, I was at a large rural property with several buildings that were open to the environments. They were missing a large exterior wall and so they had the appearances of being a large shed. A lot of people were there and it seemed like a celebration of some kind, like a Fourth of July or Memorial Day celebration. I was walking from table to table looking for food and listening to interactions but not really engaging with anyone. Eventually I wandered into a barn where Garth from Wayne's World was setting up a television and watching cartoons. I was able to mod the TV to play videos from our phones, but some people found the Simpsons on another TV and began to watch that. Eventually a few rugby teams started to gather around and play a game where they threw a ball high up into the air and then they put on certain masks based on who caught the ball. There were white masks and camouflage masks, and it was clear that they were dividing up into teams. I did not want to play the game with them but I watched curiously. We all got into a minivan at one point and drove off to an open field with sound sculptures and bouncy castles. Everyone had the same adidas shoes and I couldn't find mine, but I looked around profusely.
