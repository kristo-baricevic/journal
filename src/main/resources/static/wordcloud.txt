I have been carrying depression with me through the night. I have been taking it to bed and then waking up with it the next morning. Though I try to think positive thoughts I seem to summon it in my dreams and wake up with a feeling in the deeps of my chest. I try to push through and create lightness out of my heavy thoughts. Sometimes the depression feels more like habit than anything else. Habits built from periods of isolation in the past. I have so much grief for different versions of myself. These different versions live within in, waiting to be activated by subtle triggers. It is my duty to give them space and to find healthy ways to grieve so that I can set the sadness aside and make room for happy movement. I am determined to make the most of this life and to take my pain and transform it into my greatest strength. It is this drive that pushes me through the darkest moments and causes me to go outside on the rainiest of days.
