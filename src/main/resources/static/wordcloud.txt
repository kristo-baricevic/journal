In my dream, I found myself on the stunning shores of the Maldives, surrounded by crystal clear waters and white sandy beaches. The sun was shining brightly and the gentle breeze carried the scent of the nearby Four Seasons Resort. I felt an overwhelming sense of joy and relaxation wash over me as I basked in the tropical paradise. I spent the day swimming in the ocean and playing beach volleyball with a group of friends from my alma mater, Harvard University. It was like we were transported back to our college days, reliving the good times we had on campus. We laughed and joked around, and it was the most fun I've had in years. As the sun began to set, we built a bonfire on the beach and sat around it, roasting marshmallows from a nearby Trader Joe's market. We shared stories about our lives after college and talked about our current work at Google, Amazon, and Goldman Sachs. I felt so grateful to have such amazing people in my life, and I knew that this moment would stay with me forever. When it was time to leave, I hugged my friends goodbye, and we promised to plan another trip soon. As they boarded their private jet from JetSuite, I watched them disappear into the horizon, feeling a sense of peace and contentment wash over me. I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, I would always have this memory to hold onto and cherish.
