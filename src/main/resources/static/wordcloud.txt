I had a dream that I was being constantly degraded by my mother and siblings for the clothes I was wearing. They weren't my clothes; they belonged to my sister. My sister had some friends over and they all began to take issue with my wearing them and they gave me food items I could not hold so that they would fall and ruin the clothing. Then I changed into other clothes and Mom criticized me for never being able to find clothes that looked good, and said it was a reason why I could not socialize with my peer group. They all began to ignore me but still expected that I follow them around the house. I felt very upset, but directed those feelings inward. 

Before long I was following a tour of a house that CJ and Grey Jr. had rehabbed. The work was shoddy at best, and they made jokes of it but the rest of the people in the tour had no issue with it and were putting offers on the house. I tried to walk through a doorway that was not big enough to fit through and it knocked the drywall and tile off of the frame. The tile was painted with latex paint instead of being burned to color in the kiln. Everyone was upset at me for causing a mess because the house was under contract and CJ and Grey did not want to redo anything. I have been carrying depression with me through the night. I have been taking it to bed and then waking up with it the next morning. Though I try to think positive thoughts I seem to summon it in my dreams and wake up with a feeling in the deeps of my chest. I try to push through and create lightness out of my heavy thoughts. Sometimes the depression feels more like habit than anything else. Habits built from periods of isolation in the past. I have so much grief for different versions of myself. These different versions live within in, waiting to be activated by subtle triggers. It is my duty to give them space and to find healthy ways to grieve so that I can set the sadness aside and make room for happy movement. I am determined to make the most of this life and to take my pain and transform it into my greatest strength. It is this drive that pushes me through the darkest moments and causes me to go outside on the rainiest of days. I was moving away from St. Louis and all of my things were spread out. Some were at Sean's parents house. Some were at Sarah and Zeng's house. Some were at the house I lived at. Most had already been moved to my new home in Philadelphia but I was back to get the rest. During this dream I was at a party and ran into several old punks who had become police officers. One of them was Tom, a drummer with whom I joked that real punks always show their license and registration. He had said he got the job because he had a kid and needed the money. I also saw Ashley, with whom I spoke about moving. For some reason I told her I was moving to Chattanooga even though that was not the case. I continued walking around this party at my dream until it became time to start packing. But I quickly realized I did not have enough room in my car to take everything. I had gotten a ride from Sarah and Nina back to the house where my stuff was to figure it out. The night before Nina had kept crawling into bed with me and turning on the TV or stereo, and jumping up and down. Eventually I told her I had to go to sleep and to leave the TV off and she went away. Before I knew it I was getting my things ready but I just decided to leave it all behind. The next thing I knew I was in a car driving through the winding roads of a heavily wooded mountain. Someone else was driving. It may have been my older brother at one point, but the person kept changing. At first it seemed like a self-driving car because we were both in the back seat, but the driver was making decisions. We stopped at a strip mall for a break and the ground kept tilting like a slow moving earthquake. We wanted to continue driving but there was a forest fire so we got a hotel room. In the hotel room I was all of a sudden with Larva and we were watching TV while engaging in a sex act. Over time we both turned into spiders that were making out on a fire escape, until it became time for her to go into a nightclub below us and perform as part of a comedy act.
